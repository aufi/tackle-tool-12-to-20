# tackle-tool-12-to-20

A tool migrating Konveyor Tackle 1.2 data into Tackle 2.0. For more details about Tackle, see https://github.com/konveyor/tackle-documentation

Under initial development

## Notes

jinja templates with variables to push data to Tackle 2 API, makefile&bash seems to be too messy, trying ansible to provide some level of structure of the project and open-ness for customizations
